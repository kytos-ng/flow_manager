All notable changes to the flow_manager NApp project will be documented in this
file.

[UNRELEASED] - Under development
********************************

Added
=====

- Added endpoint ``GET v2/stored_flows`` for listing flows from flows collection. Query parameter filter for `state` and `dpid` is supported. A list of flows per switch is returned.

Fixed
=====
- Fixed handling ``OFPT_ERROR`` correctly when OF negotiation fails
- Fixed consistency check to run immediately when FlowStats is first received.
- Fixed flow ``instructions`` to be stored.
- Handled connection exception corner case before an OpenFlow handshake

Changed
=======

Deprecated
==========

Removed
=======
- Removed support for OpenFlow 1.0
- Removed `serializers` package

Security
========

[2022.2.0] - 2022-08-08
***********************

Added
=====
- MongoDB integration with ``pymongo``
- Added and soft deleted flows are stored now on MongoDB ``flows`` collections.
- Consistency checks executions are stored on MongoDB ``flow_checks`` collection
- FlowController and DB models
- Added log.info entry for kytos.flow_manager.flows.(install|delete) handler for troubleshooting
- ``CONSISTENCY_MIN_VERDICT_INTERVAL``, granular control for the minimum expected interval that consistency check should wait before detecting inconsistencies

Changed
=======
- Refactored consistency check to leverage ``flow_id`` and ``match_id``
- Refactored `flows` upsert and delete operations to use `bulk_write` instead for higher performance based on the expected workload
- Endpoint /flow_manager/v2/flows/ writes first to the database now to optimize consistency for bulk operations.
- Set KytosEvent priority for OFPT_FLOW_MOD and OFPT_BARRIER_REQUEST
- OFPT_BARRIER_REQUEST is sent in bulk once per flows
- Consistency check will act slower than ``FLOW_STATS`` to enhance consistency

Deprecated
==========
- Storehouse file system backend

Removed
=======
- Storehouse backend and its locks
- ``match13_strict`` to simplify application logic since match strict was primarily for matching an exact flow, which without wildcards is simpler to do and maintain by using ``flow_id`` (flow.id) instead
- Removed in memory archived_flows

General Information
===================
- ``scripts/storehouse_to_mongo.py`` can be used to migrate data from storehouse to MongoDB

[2022.1.2] - 2022-02-07

Added

- Stored in memory errors of flow mod xids to correlate them when a barrier reply is received.
- Added thread locks accordingly for the dictionaries used.
- Added support to delete the stored_flow once an ofpt_error when receiving a barrier reply, to avoid this flow to keep being sent via consistency check.

[5.4.0] - 2021-11.23
********************

Added
=====
- Added thread concurrency control per switch when executing check_consistency


[5.3.0] - 2021-11.21
