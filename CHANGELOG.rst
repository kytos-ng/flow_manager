file.

[UNRELEASED] - Under development
********************************

[2023.2.1] - 2024-11-01
***********************

Fixed
=====
- Only update flows as ``'installed'`` if they were ``'pending'``. This fixed processing late barrier replies correctly even if there was a recent related flow deletion.

[2023.2.0] - 2024-02-16
***********************

Changed
=======

- Augmented ``GET v2/stored_flows`` ``cookie_range`` to accept an even list of ranges
- Augmented ``GET v2/stored_flows`` ``cookie_range`` to accept this filter via json body too. If both ``cookie_range`` query arg and body are set, the body values will have a higher preference.

Fixed
=====
- Fixed updating flow installed state when handling ``kytos/of_core.flow_stats.received``


[2023.1.0] - 2023-06-05
***********************

Added
=====

- Added support for VLAN with mask. ``dl_vlan`` now also supports a string ``"vlan/mask"``.
- Added two new fields to the collection ``flows``. ``owner`` has the name of the NApp that created the flow. ``table_group`` is the classification of a flow, for example: ``epl``, ``base`` and ``evpl``.
- Added basic validation for ``cookie`` and ``cookie_mask`` when installing or removing flows.
- Augmented ``GET v2/stored_flows`` state query filter to support a list of values.

Changed
=======
- Update endpoint ``GET v2/stored_flows`` to return the flows in order by ``priority`` descending and ``updated_at`` ascending.
- Update endpoint ``GET v2/stored_flows`` to return the flows in descending order by `priority`.
- When creating a flow, ``actions`` and ``instruction`` are not allowed to be present at the same time.
- Reduced the number of flows shown in the logs. Maximum number of shown flows is 200.

General Information
===================
- ``@rest`` endpoints are now run by ``starlette/uvicorn`` instead of ``flask/werkzeug``.
- Added new script ``scripts/pipeline_related.py`` to add new fields ``owner`` and ``table_group`` to the flows on the collection ``flows`` on MongoDB. If you are planning to use ``kytos/of_multi_table`` NApp and is upgrading to 2023.1 from 2022.3, you should use this script
- ``scripts/drop_compound_index.py`` can be used to drop a compound index that has changed. If you tried to upgrade to ``2022.3.2`` before and it ended up creating ``'flow.priority_1'`` index, then you also want to delete it by running ``CMD=drop_index INDEX_NAME=flow.priority_1 python3 drop_compound_index.py``

Fixed
=====
- Fixed matching flows when trying to delete flows with specified ``table_id``.


[2022.3.1] - 2023-02-17
***********************

Added
=====
- Handled ``PackException`` to return bad request if a flow can't be packed.
- Fixed not iterable error when sending a FlowMod during OpenFlow connection.


[2022.3.0] - 2022-12-15
***********************

Added
=====

- Added endpoint ``GET v2/stored_flows`` for listing flows from flows collection. Query parameter filter for `state` and `dpid` is supported. A list of flows per switch is returned.
- Added query parameter filter for `cookie_range` to the endpoint ``GET v2/stored_flows``.
- Added query parameter filter for `state` to the endpoint ``GET v2/stored_flows``.

Fixed
=====
- Fixed handling ``OFPT_ERROR`` correctly when OF negotiation fails
- Fixed consistency check to run immediately when FlowStats is first received.
- Fixed flow ``instructions`` to be stored.
- Handled connection exception corner case before an OpenFlow handshake

Removed
=======
- Removed support for OpenFlow 1.0
- Removed ``serializers`` package


[2022.2.0] - 2022-08-08
***********************

Added
=====
- MongoDB integration with ``pymongo``
- Added and soft deleted flows are stored now on MongoDB ``flows`` collections.
- Consistency checks executions are stored on MongoDB ``flow_checks`` collection
- FlowController and DB models
- Added log.info entry for kytos.flow_manager.flows.(install|delete) handler for troubleshooting
- ``CONSISTENCY_MIN_VERDICT_INTERVAL``, granular control for the minimum expected interval that consistency check should wait before detecting inconsistencies

Changed
=======
- Refactored consistency check to leverage ``flow_id`` and ``match_id``
- Refactored `flows` upsert and delete operations to use `bulk_write` instead for higher performance based on the expected workload
- Endpoint /flow_manager/v2/flows/ writes first to the database now to optimize consistency for bulk operations.
- Set KytosEvent priority for OFPT_FLOW_MOD and OFPT_BARRIER_REQUEST
- OFPT_BARRIER_REQUEST is sent in bulk once per flows
- Consistency check will act slower than ``FLOW_STATS`` to enhance consistency

Deprecated
==========
- Storehouse file system backend

Removed
=======
- Storehouse backend and its locks
- ``match13_strict`` to simplify application logic since match strict was primarily for matching an exact flow, which without wildcards is simpler to do and maintain by using ``flow_id`` (flow.id) instead
- Removed in memory archived_flows

General Information
===================
- ``scripts/storehouse_to_mongo.py`` can be used to migrate data from storehouse to MongoDB

- Stored in memory errors of flow mod xids to correlate them when a barrier reply is received.
- Added thread locks accordingly for the dictionaries used.
- Added support to delete the stored_flow once an ofpt_error when receiving a barrier reply, to avoid this flow to keep being sent via consistency check.
